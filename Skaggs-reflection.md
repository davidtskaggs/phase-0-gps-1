# GPS 1.1 - Version Control and Git

## Release 7: Reflect
1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
* Fetch, Merge, Resolving Merge Conflicts.

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
* Resolving merge conflicts.

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
* A few times, I asked our guide if we were on track with our train of thought.
* I asked guide if we could continue working on this hangout after he left or if we needed to create new hangout.
* I asked my pair for help with a specific command regarding moving a file from one directory to another.
* I asked my pair if he had any knowledge of how the git fetch & git merge work.
* I asked my pair if he would be attending the study group tomorrow in NYC.

4. What still confuses you about Git?
* I struggled with grasping git fetch <remote> <branch> and merge <remote> <branch>.

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
* Overall, I thought it was a great pairing session. I enjoyed working with Thomas and Brison. The GPS Releases were challenging and thoughtprovoking! The releases combined previously learned information while also taking the challenges one step further. I think that it is very helpful gain experience in pair-programming and to articulate your code outloud.
