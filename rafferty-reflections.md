  • What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  ⁃ I felt comfortable with Git concerts before coming into the session from week one, but working with other individuals made me realize I should try to have commands more at my finger tips, particularly because I was the navigator during the first part.  Even though I practiced them a lot during week one, I think I may have been relying on my notes and previous commands to much.  Before my next GPS I will work on having the commands from the previous week more available in my head.

  • What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  ⁃ I found this GPS to be helpful in setting up the way a GPS flows.  It was great to see GitHub in action with multiple collaborators working together to merge.  As the session continued I grew more and more comfortable with GitHub along the lines of working together and being having Git commands at my fingertips.  After our guide left we also worked our way through adding a image to markdown with some research.

  • What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  ⁃ Our guild was helpful in affirming that we were working correctly, particularly as we shifted from working with GitHub on an individual level to working as a team.  I found working with David to be very rewarding bouncing ideas and syntax of each other to continually make progress.

  • What still confuses you about Git?
  ⁃ We spent a lot of time on fetch, having not worked with that command.  We did a lot of research for that was the part we just had come up to when our guild left but I felt like we both did not have a full grasp of it when we finished.  I have done more research (and I believe David has as well) and we are communicating that to each other to gain a greater leave of comfort moving forward.

  • How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  ⁃ I found it to be a really helpful experience.  Continuing to work on Git and GitHub provided lots of practice in making Git and GitHub workflow go from something that took lots of thought to being more instinctual.  I also found working in a pair to be helpful, it may be a clique but two heads are simply better than one.
